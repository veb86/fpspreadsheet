   "Description" : "FPSpreadsheetControls are a set of visual components which facilitate creation of a spreadsheet application.\n\n- TsWorkbookSource is the base of the package, it links the visual components to a workbook instance and its worksheets and cells.\n\n- TsWorkbookTabControl is a TabControl which displays tabs for each worksheet of the workbook. Changing the active tab selects the corresponding worksheet.\n\n- TsWorksheetGrid is a grid component which displays the contents of a worksheet. It communicates with the TsWorkbookSource by receiving and sending messages on the selected cell.\n\n- TsCellEdit is a multi-line edit control (memo) for entering for cell values and formulas. Pressing ENTER transfers the current text into the worksheet.\n\n- TsCellIndicator is a simple edit used to display the address of the currently selected cell. Editing the text allows to jump to the cell address.\n\n- TsSpreadsheetInspector is a StringGrid (ValueListEditor, to be precise) which displays details on the workbook, the selected worksheet, and the selected cell values and properties.\n\n- Linking these controls to a TsWorkbookSource results in a working spreadsheet appliation without writing any line of code.\n\nThe demo application in the folder \"fpsctrls_no_install\" can be run without installing the visual FPSpreadsheet packages."}
